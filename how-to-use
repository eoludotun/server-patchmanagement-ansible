I assume that you have already cloned this repo or downloaded all the necessary files. After that you have to do the following steps to get the RHEL-Patchmanagement to work.

Edit run_rhel_patch_mgmt.sh and insert the sshkey which is used to connect to your nodes.
Create a cronjob which runs run_rhel_patch_mgmt.sh on every Tuesday and Wednesday at a chosen time. The script will trigger the ansible playbook at the times as mentioned in the use case above. You could adjust it to your needs.
You may have to edit patch_rhel.yml to fit your needs. By default this playbook runs on all hosts of your inventory which have a Red Hat operating system installed and which are member of the corresponding rhel-patch-phaseX group.
Rename variables.txt.example to variables.txt and edit the file accordingly to fit your environment.
Edit create_vars.sh and set source to the abolute path for the variables file.
Per default create_vars.sh runs on the first Tuesday of month to create a new vars/main.yml file with a current patch set and the file mail_text.txt.
